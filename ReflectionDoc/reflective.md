 ### 22.08.2025
  1. What I did this week:
  - Connected the frontend with the backend timesheet check API, now showing ✔/✘ results from backend checks.
  - Added the ability to manually change ✔/✘ for human review.
  - Implemented the feature to automatically generate a signature when all checks pass.
  - Created the frontend page to display the checking results and reviewing table
  2. Plan for next week:
  - Prepare one clear mismatch test case to showcase error detection.
  - Improve the UI layout and usability.
  - Merging frontend branch into main.
  3. Hurdles:
  - Encountered backend constant mismatch at first but solved it after debugging.

### 29.08.25
  1. What I did this week:
  - Tested the review page to ensure normal operation.
  - Verified the connection between backend and frontend after integration.
  - Successfully merged into main and checked that the connection still works after merge.
  2. Plan for next week:
  - Get the review table data dynamically from the backend instead of using hard-coded samples.
  - Generate a page that shows each employee’s payroll details
  3. Hurdles:
  - Encounters merge conflict when merge branch Cheryl-Validation-Frontend into main at first.
  - The current review table is still a static sample, so it cannot yet fetch real data.
